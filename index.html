                <h2>Hello</h2>
                <p class="page-description">This web project is a kind of living repository of digital materials to
                    accompany the Queer Geography
                    exhibition planned for the spring of 2020. The proposed exhibition consists of artwork created by
                    visual art student, Dev McCauley, for the Seattle University Art and Art History departmental honors
                    project.</p>
                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p class="page-description">At play in this project is the exploration of three critical concepts. One,
                    artistic
                    process & accessibility; both the accessibility of the process of art making to a public, and the
                    accessibility of art as a medium to make abstract/foreign concepts and experiences
                    tangible/understood/felt by that public (experience as a means of learning and empathizing). Two,
                    identity formation, expression, and representation; specifically, how queer people understand,
                    express, and see represented their own identities in relation to other non-queer identities. Three,
                    queer geographies; this encompasses the relational politics of space—e.g. how a queer person
                    navigates, participates, and otherwise exists in the spaces of a heteronormative society.</p>
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p class="page-description">The goal of this webpage is to track the progress of this ongoing project,
                    and to offer ‘digital window’ into
                    Dev’s process of research and art-making. In turn, the webpage becomes a kind of abstract queered
                    space—created and occupied by a queer artist.
